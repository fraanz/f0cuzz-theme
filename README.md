# f0cuzz-theme
Experiment - unix system theming to avoid information overload

Hola! Since this is a gloabl system theme, and since everyone's system is different, I wont distribute a buggy do-everything 
installer script. Rather, I'm giving you the freedom to do this by yourself. Don't worry, if you don't lose focus (eheh) in ten minutes 
you'll be done with 10x better result than an automatic script.

For reference on how to do single things, check [my website](https://fraanz.github.io/) or the [gentoo wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org).

### Section 0: the boot process
 * If you can, disable bios debug messages (and intel subliminal logo XD)
 * Grub is evil, but if you are using it install a minimal black theme
 * Disable non-critical kernel and init messages
 * Use a flat, black, desktop manager theme

### Section 1: desktop environment
Ready? If you followed correctly the previous instruction, you should have a beautiful, minimal, 0-overload boot process. Your mind is
still clean. Now you have to configure your working space.

 * Start with a minimal window manager. Remove everything from the screen.
 * Use a solid dark background (or other colors but beware of their effects on your mind... not kidding, every color has its own effects!)
 * Desktop bar and windows titles are useful, but configure them in order to have only the bare minimum to get your work done
  
### Section 2: software choice
Oh, this is the hardest part... I'm still working on it. As general guideline, terminal software should have less clutter than graphical
equivalents... but I'm not sure however.  
You can start by choosing a modern minimal gtk/qt theme + icon set. Fonts also should be easy to read.

I'm testing this configuration to see if it works for me. Have you made any progress in the fight to mental fuzziness caused by bad 
interfaces? Let us know, so it will be useful to everyone.
